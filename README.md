# glen's dotfiles
A collection of my dotfiles with an included deploy script to completely replace (with backups of course) all vim, zsh, tmux configurations.
I recommend that you do not blindly run the script and instead pick out the bits and pieces that you find useful.
Especially because the gitconfig file contains references to my own username, email, and name. Everything else should be user-agnostic.

I (think) it depends on solarized colorscheme and powerline fonts in your terminal or everything will look like shit.

TODO:
* remove dependencies on oh my zsh
* fix neocomplcache and nerdtree and ctrlp
* add in .profile .bash_profile and .zsh_profile
* get better buffer navigator
* learn how to use fugitive

Some plugins to add:
* vim-view maybe
